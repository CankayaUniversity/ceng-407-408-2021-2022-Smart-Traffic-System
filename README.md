Smart Traffic System

1) The general purpose of our project is to recognize vehicles(car,motorcyle,truck , etc...) waiting at the light and to calculate the minimum waiting time at red,  at the same time detecting and facilitating roadworks and similar operations on roads where errors are detected.

2) Since the target audience of the project was the municipalities at the beginning, we created a website for the municipalities to use the system easily and to perform all kinds of transactions easily.

3) The section where the traffic lights are monitored and the algorithm is applied is available on our website.

4) In our algorithm that we put on our website, it counts the number of vehicles on the upper left and categorizes them. Our system gives an error after the number of vehicles waiting in the red exceeds a certain level. At the same time, if the same vehicle could not pass between 2 red lights, our system gives an error again and reports that excavation work should be done in this area.
