  description:
    'Smart Traffic Systems are technology solutions that municipalities can integrate into their traffic cabinets and intersections today for fast, cost-effective improvements in safety and traffic flow on their city streets. Today, Smart Traffic Systems make it possible to increase the capacity of city streets without actually adding new roads. With the advent of connected vehicle technology, these systems will also be able to directly control vehicles when needed â€” braking them in intersections, for example, to prevent accidents with pedestrians or other vehicles.',

  description:
    'Smart traffic  systems are helping cities and law enforcement agencies improve traffic and parking management around the world. Smart traffic management systems ensure connected citywide data collection and analysis, while alerting when immediate action and precautions are needed. Using AI-enhanced video sensor technology to analyze traffic patterns and driving behaviors gives law enforcement and authorities the data needed to reduce traffic accidents, minimize traffic congestion and improve mobility city wide. This allows us to avoid unnecessary road works and focus on the areas where it is necessary.',

    'The aim of our project is to adjust the duration of the traffic light according to the vehicles in areas with heavy and congested traffic. This problem is solved by counting the vehicles waiting at the lights with the help of algorithms and adjusting the duration of the traffic light according to the number of vehicles. At the same time, the algorithm makes calculations according to the type of vehicle (Car , Motorcyle , Truck , etc.) and shorten or increase the waiting time.',
